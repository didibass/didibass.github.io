<h2>The Long Version</h2>

<h3>Early Years</h3>
<p>Didi's parents arrived in Australia from Indonesia in the early 1960's as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo_Plan#Programmes" target="_blank">Colombo Plan</a> scholarship programme. Born in Melbourne to a musical family, his father taught him three-chord ukulele songs at age seven. Didi had a wandering childhood, living in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Malaysia before the age of 12. After starting his first 'jazz band' in Jakarta in 1985, he eventually made his way to back to Australia.</p>

<h3>Sydney Start</h3>
<p>Soon after graduating from the Sydney Conservatorium in 1997 (bass guitar major), Didi was a piano accompanist at the Sydney Four Seasons from 2000 to 2005. In this post, he played with and learned from Sydney's top bassplayers and music educators <a href="http://www.craigscott.com.au/" target="_blank">Craig Scott</a> (ex. Joe Henderson, Lee Konitz, Nat Adderly) and <a href="http://www.aim.edu.au/teachers/gary-holgate" target="_blank">Gary Holgate</a> (ex. Randy Brecker, Mark Murphy, Annie Ross), accompanying the likes of <a href="http://www.greggarthur.com/" target="_blank">Gregg Arthur</a> and <a href="Katrina Rettalick" target="_blank">Katrina Rettalick</a>. Meanwhile, his creative endeavours included stints with <a href="http://tjeckleberg.com/" target="_blank">TJ Eckleberg</a> and <a href="http://www.weizenho.com" target="_blank">Weizen Ho</a>. In the education field, Didi accompanied teachers and students of workshops and masterclasses held at the Sydney Conservatorium by leading jazz vocal educators <a href="http://pamelaknowles.com/" target="_blank">Pamela Knowles</a>, <a href="http://www.joyyates-davemacrae.com/" target="_blank">Joy Yates</a>, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nicky-crayson" target="_blank">Nicky Crayson</a>. </p>
<p>Working primarily as a singer accompanist, Didi eventually developed an interest in singing himself, and studied jazz vocals under <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/kerrie-biddell-the-first-lady-of-australian-jazz-20140909-10eaff" target="_blank">Kerrie Biddell</a>. He also took part in workshops and masterclasses by US jazz vocalists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Carter" target="_blank">Betty Carter</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Murphy_%28singer%29" target="_blank">Mark Murphy</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Elling" target="_blank">Kurt Elling</a>.</p>

<h3>Adventures in Asia</h3>
<p>In 2005, Didi left Australia for China as part of <a href="http://www.nikkidoll.com/" target="_blank">Nikki Doll and The Voodoo Blue</a> for a 6-month engagement in Shanghai and Beijing. Nikki and the rest of The Voodoo Blue returned to Sydney after this engagement, but Didi stayed on and continued over a decade of touring the Asia-Pacific region. He performed at the 2007 Sapporo Jazz Festival in Japan fronting his own trio featuring <a href="http://davegoodman.com.au/" target="_blank">Dave Goodman</a> on drums and Kyo Kitagaki on bass, a highlight of his Asian travels. While abroad, he continued to put his accompanying skills to good use, backing ex. Motown singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Taylor_%26_the_Vancouvers&quot; target=&quot;_blank" target="_blank">Bobby Taylor</a> in Beijing, Shanghai jazz singer <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jasminechenmusic/" target="_blank">Jasmine Chen</a> and Indonesian jazz singer <a href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherly_O" target="_blank">Sherly O</a>.</p>

<h3>Perth via Sydney and Asia</h3>
<p>Returning to Sydney in 2009, Didi met Singaporean jazz singer-songwriter <a href="http://julietpang.net" target="_blank">Juliet Pang</a> at a jazz open mic. They formed the popular ukulele duo <a href="http://facebook.com/apugnosedream/" target="_blank">Polkadot + Moonbeam</a> and piano duo <a href="http://facebook.com/wearemint/" target="_blank">Mint Street</a>, and were based from 2011 in Singapore, from which they toured Australia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. Juliet and Didi married in Singapore in 2013, and in 2016 settled in Perth Australia as music educators, sharing their wealth of music performance experience to students of music in the local region.</p>
