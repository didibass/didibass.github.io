# Lessons

If you would like to further develop your bass playing, I am available for one-on-one private lessons at my studio in Victoria Park, Perth. My rates are $65/hour or $200 for a package of 4 x 1-hour lessons.

I am also available for rhythm-section group workshops or masterclasses at a venue of your choice.

Please contact me on [lessons@didi.com.au](mailto:lessons@didi.com.au) or (08) 6102 0525 for more details.
