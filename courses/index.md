## Practical Jazz Ensemble Skills for Jazz Singers

This course is designed for jazz singers who want to improve their practical skills in performing with jazz musicians. If you are an intermediate level jazz singer with a balanced repertoire of over 12 jazz songs and would like to start performing with jazz musicians (or have already started but wish to improve your jazz ensemble skills), this course is for you.

Topics include providing clear chord charts in your key, counting-in the band, types of impromptu intros, jazz band protocol for improvising/soloing, signalling endings, planning a setlist and how to scat. (Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced)

## Four-Finger Jazz Piano

Lush chords are one of the characteristics that typify jazz standards. Did you know that with only four notes/fingers per chord, you can play a simplified yet functional version of these lush chords? The question is of course: which four notes, and which four fingers? This course will show you how. It is recommended for jazz singers or horn players who want a taste of rudimentary jazz piano. With this basic skill, you can play jazz piano accompaniment while you sing, make simple backing tracks to practice with, or simply gain confidence to learn more jazz piano. (Skill Level: Beginner)

## Jazz Bass Guitar

When it comes to jazz, bassplayers are often expected to be able to play walking bass, weaving a melodic line that is rhythmically solid while providing good musical signposts of the oncoming chord progression. Jazz bassplayers are also expected to be able to improvise. In this course, you will learn both how to walk the bass and improvise. It is recommended for bassplayers who are already proficient on their instrument but would like to explore jazz. (Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced)
